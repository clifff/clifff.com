My name is Clif Reeder, and I'm a software engineer working in Washington DC.
I specialize in desinging and building [highly stable, scalable consumer facing websites](http://product.voxmedia.com/2012/6/15/5426782/introducing-syllabus-vox-medias-s3-powered-liveblog-platform)
and [refactoring large code bases](http://product.voxmedia.com/2014/5/29/5759244/vox-media-ruby-rails-upgrade-chorus).

Previously, I was a principal full stack engineer at Vox Media from 2011 to 2015.
Prior to that, I graduated from the University of Michigan (Go Blue!) with a degree in Computer Science Engineering.
My language and framework of choice is Ruby on Rails, but I have built and worked on Go and [Python based applications](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor/commits?author=clifff) as well.

I'm available for freelance work. [Please reach out if you are interested in building something together!](mailto:clifreeder@gmail.com)
