As you may know, I'm currently a developer at Vox Media, and a proud
member of their Product Team. This is the term we use to describe all of
the designers, developers, community/product managers and ops folk that
produce the platform that powers [SB Nation](http://www.sbnation.com), [The
Verge](http://www.theverge.com) and the upcoming [Polygon](http://www.polygon.com).

We've recently launched a blog to talk about the work we do. I happen to
think it's pretty cool, and you should [check it out here](http://product.voxmedia.com/).

I wrote one of the inaugural posts entitled [Developing with
Production Data](http://product.voxmedia.com/post/21876312260/developing-with-production-data), which
gives a brief overview of a talk I gave at the DC Ruby Users Group in
[April](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/events/25856291/). Since the post
is pretty short, I'll just say that you should check it out. If you are
too lazy for that, the [slides are here](http://blog.clifreeder.com/Developing-With-Production-Data/).

In the future, I'll probably be writing more for the Vox Product blog,
so expect to see some more links back there in the future.
