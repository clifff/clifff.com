This last week I attended [Rails Conf 2012](http://railsconf2012.com/)
in Austin, which was a welcome contrast to my SXSW experience.
I found lots of talks that where interesting and applicable to
problems/questions I have in day to day Rails development. If you are
curious about specific content, I highly recommend checking out this
[wiki of presentation notes](https://github.com/newhavenrb/railsconf2012/wiki) created by the New Haven Ruby group.

The other thing is that I bought an iPad recently and used the Paper to take
notes for a number of the talks. Although the process was a little slow,
I'd like to try it with a stylus and expect to continue to do the same
thing in the future.

Here are some quick thoughts/notes about talks I found particularly interesting.
I took these using the Paper app for iPad, which I quite enjoyed and
would recommend.

## Realtime Web Apps w/ REST

This talk was basically an introduction/debut for the [Firehose.io](http://firehose.io) project,
which is pub/sub server to help with creating RESTful streaming web apps. Highly relevant to
a project in planning stages, and would love to try out in the future.

## Patella

[Patella](https://github.com/kbrock/patella) which is a gem that
provides memoization into memcached backed by Resque (buzzwords!).
What that means it is provides some caching tools to make sure that
whenever a client hits a cache block that misses, it returns an empty
value and calculates that value via Resque rather than slowing down the
client's request.

## Making the Web Faster w/ Google

<iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="http://imgur.com/a/UeaNK/embed"></iframe>

A generally interesting talk, with the biggest take-away being that
things like page load time are already tracked in Google Analytics.
Would have been a nice thing to know before I setup a cron job that
tracks that for some Vox pages w/ PhantomJS.

Left with a bit of shame and large determination to prioritize page load
times on projects I'm on.

## Evented Ruby VS Node.js

<iframe class="imgur-album" width="100%" height="550" frameborder="0" src="http://imgur.com/a/qoBlm/embed"></iframe>

This was a pretty informative talk. It made me actually understand
evented frameworks and that although they are more CPU efficient, they
aren't any more likely to complete a request any faster. Also worth
noting that it left me with almost no desire to try out evented
programming in Ruby.
