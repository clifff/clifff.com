As promised, another link to something I wrote for the Vox Product Blog.
We recently launched our own liveblog tool (called Syllabus), which uses Amazon S3 to handle
scaling to hundereds of thousands of users.
The post is mosty about the system architecture, which I think is pretty cool.

So here it is - [Introducing Syllabus, Vox Media's S3 powered liveblog platform](http://product.voxmedia.com/post/25113965826/introducing-syllabus-vox-medias-s3-powered-liveblog).

As a side note, working on this project was a perfect example of how much fun it it is to create and launch something with 
talented people. It doesn't get much better than that.
